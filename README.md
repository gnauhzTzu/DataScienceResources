MISSING DATA

********************************************
TIPS IN PRACTICE

As far as I know, `fread()` in `data.table` has the best performance in importing (big) csv files. It also has a lot convenience features:

https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki/Convenience-features-of-fread

Most of the versions update (say 3.10.0.8 and 3.10.0.10) in h2o will break the existing model, which means, the model trained on old versions cannot be imported by new versions of h2o.
tips on h2o troubleshooting
https://support.h2o.ai/support/solutions/articles/17000012114-h2o-troubleshooting-tips

Certain algorithms in sklearn, XGBoost can only have numerical values as their predictor variables. Hence Label Encoding or One Hot Encoding becomes necessary. But in H2O say Distributed Random Forest, you can use categorical variables in input data frame, H2O will deal with it.

how to properly **cross-validate** when we have **imbalanced** data: 
 
 * Oversampling the minority class can result in over-fitting problems if we oversample before cross-validating
 * Undersampling could solve the class imbalance issue and increased the sensitivity of our models, but results could be poor because the more imbalanced the dataset the more samples will be discarded when undersampling, therefore throwing away potentially useful information. 
 * I found deep neural network models could deal with the imbalanced dataset better when having at least more than 30 features.
 * Perform feature selection before we go into cross-validation.
 * oversampling must be part of the cross-validation and not done before. 
    * Inside the cross-validation loop, get a sample out and do not use it for anything related to features selection, oversampling or model building.
    * Oversample your minority class, without the sample you already excluded.
    * Use the excluded sample for validation, and the oversampled minority class + the majority class, to create the model.
    * Repeat n times, where n is your number of samples (if doing leave one participant out cross-validation).

**Sparse Matrix**

http://math.ucla.edu/~dakuang/cse6040/lectures/6040_lecture8.pdf
- Advantages of the CSR format
    - efficient arithmetic operations CSR + CSR, CSR * CSR, etc.
    - efficient row slicing
    - fast matrix vector products
- Disadvantages of the CSR format
    - slow column slicing operations (consider CSC)
    - changes to the sparsity structure are expensive (consider LIL or DOK)

Storage efficient of COO,CSR,CSC,DIA,ELL,HYB etc.

when it's **not easy/expensive to know the real dimension of the feature vector**. For example, the **bag-of-word** representation in document classification problem requires scanning entire dataset to know how many words we have, i.e. the dimension of the feature vector. We can use [Feature hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_hashing):

FEATURE ENGINEERING

* feature selection: https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/courses/294-fall09/lectures/feature/slides.pdf

* **my strategy**
    * extract features based on understanding of the data and goal
    * evaluate features by precision rate, coverage area and complexity
    * how to get and store the features
    * clean outliers/weighted sampling/data unbalance sampling
  * **single feature**: regularization, discretization, dummy coding
    * missing value imputation,logarithm transfer, exponential transfer, Box-Cox
  * **multiple features**: PCA, LDA
    * **filter**: correlation with the dependent variable. Pearsonâ€™s Correlation, LDA, ANOVA, Chi-Square, information gain.
    * **wrapper methods**: iteration to generate subset of features to train model. then using AUC/MSE, BIC, AIC etc. to decide to add or remove features based on the previous model, such as forward/backward/recursive feature elimination.
        * full search, heuristic search, stochastic search(GA, SA).
        * usually computationally very expensive. 
    * **embedded methods**, implemented by algorithms that have their own built-in feature selection methods. LASSO(L1)/RIDGE(L2) regression, regularized trees, random multinomial logit, deep learning.
   * should be pay attention to the quality and weight of features by monitor the algorithms

Use Z-test with two assumptions: the probability of common success is approximate 0.5, and the number of samples is very high

DATA VISUALIZATION

Plotly, an interactive visualization tool, it can be used with python, js, R spark, d3 etc. I like plotly's default color scale and it's strong interactive ability. But they really need to make their api documentation more readable and sometimes the version update of plotly will bring several version compatible troubles.  
https://plot.ly/python/apache-spark/
https://plot.ly/~morpheos/367/forecast-time-series-spark/

Using plotly, python, sqlite to explore the 3.9G csv from NYC open data. Using sqlite is a lightweight and good choose especially when dealing GB level data and when the data finally used for visualization is not that big. Can do all the summarize and aggregation in database. https://plot.ly/python/big-data-analytics-with-pandas-and-sqlite/

Fastest way to check if any NaN in data frame is `df.isnull().values.any()`
`df.isnull().values.sum()` is a bit slower, but show the number of NaNs.
